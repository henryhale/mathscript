## Overview

MathFlow is a lightweight and expressive scripting language designed for mathematical expressions and calculations. It provides a simple and intuitive syntax for performing mathematical operations, including support for standard arithmetic, functions like sin, cos, tan, and other functions.

## Features

-   **Mathematical Expressions:** Perform standard arithmetic operations with ease.
-   **Functions:** Built-in support for mathematical functions such as sin, cos, tan, abs and more.
-   **Clean and Modern Syntax:** Readable and easy-to-write syntax for mathematical expressions.
-   **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST):** Utilizes an AST for parsing and interpreting expressions.
